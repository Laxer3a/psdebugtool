# PSX Log Visual Debug tool.

This is the source code for the UI based debugging tool I made for the PSX on FPGA project.
This project is based on DearImGui sample project with just some source added.
So it is not really really clean.

Open imgui_examples.sln and try to open it, should build and compile.
